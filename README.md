## Rules

- Deck of cards consists of ♠️♣️ 2-10,J,Q,K,Ace and ♥️♦️ 2-10
- Diamonds are weapon cards, Hearts are health potions and they heal for the number given
- Spades and Clubs are Monsters
- Deck is fully shuffled
- You start on 20 health and you cannot go above 20 health, if you fall below 20 then you die
- The number on the monsters represents their attack 2-10, J=11, Q=12, K=13, Ace=14
- A room (4 cards) is drawn from the deck, you can draw your next room by either:
    - Getting the room down to 1 or less cards by; drinking health potions, killing monsters or equipping weapons
    - Running away from the room - you cannot do this two rooms in a row. When you run away from the room the remaining cards in the room are shuffled and put to the back of the deck
- You can fight a monster either:
    - with your bare hands (you will take all of the damage equal to the number on the card)
    - With a weapon, which reduces the attack of the monster equal to the difference
    - Note: When a weapon has been used, you can only kill weaker monsters than the one already killed with the weapon, eg if you killed a 5♣️ you could not kill a 7♣️ or a 5♠️, only 2-4♠️♣️
